         <h2 id="terms-honor">Honor Code</h2>
<p>By <a href="register">joining OpenML</a>, you join a special worldwide community of data scientists building on each other's results and connecting their minds as efficiently as possible. This community depends on your motivation to share data, tools and ideas, and to do so with honesty. In return, you will gain trust, visibility and reputation, igniting online collaborations and studies that otherwise may not have happened.</p>


</p>
<p>By using any part of OpenML, you agree to:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Give credit where credit is due</b>. Cite the authors whose work you are building on, or build collaborations where appropriate.</li>
<li><b>Give back to the community</b> by sharing your own data as openly and as soon as possible, or by helping the community in other ways. In doing so, you gain visibility and impact (citations).</li>
<li><b>Share data according to your best efforts</b>. <i>Everybody</i> make mistakes, but we trust you to correct them as soon as possible. Remove or flag data that cannot be trusted.</li>
<li><b>Be polite and constructive</b> in all discussions. Criticism of methods is welcomed, but personal criticisms should be avoided.</li>
<li><b>Respect circles of trust</b> when you are included in collaborations. Be considerate in sharing data with people outside this circle.</li>
<li><b>Do not steal</b> the work of people who openly share it. OpenML makes it easy to find all shared data (and when it was shared), thus everybody will know if you do this.</li>
</ul>
