	<p>The OpenML R package allows you to connect to the OpenML server from R scrips.
  This means that you can download and upload data sets and tasks, run R implementations, upload your results,
  and download all experiment results directly via R commands.</p>

  <p>It is also neatly integrated into <a href="https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr">mlr</a> (Machine Learning in R),
  which provides a unified interface to a large number of machine learning algorithms in R. As such, you can
  easily run and compare many R algorithms on all OpenML datasets, and analyse all combined results.</p>

  <p>All in a few lines of R.</p>
